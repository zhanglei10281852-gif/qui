## React Effects

- Use `useEffect` only to sync with external systems: DOM, subscriptions, network.
- Avoid derived state in Effects; calculate during render or use `useMemo` for expensive compute.
- Put user-driven logic in event handlers.
- To reset state, prefer a `key` or render-time adjustment.
- Fetch Effects must guard stale responses with cleanup/abort.

## Field help

- Field help goes in a tooltip on the field label. Use `FieldHelp` from `@/components/ui/field-help`. Do not add a help paragraph under the control.
- Keep this text inline, never in a tooltip: error and validation messages, warnings about data loss or actions the user cannot undo, and text the user must read before they choose.
- Per-option text in a radio group or a checkbox list stays inline. The user compares the options side by side and cannot do that through hovers.
- Status text, computed previews, section intros, and empty states are not field help. The rule does not apply to them.
- If the help text only repeats the label, delete it. Do not move it to a tooltip.
